Course Title: Information Security (3 Cr.)

Course Code: CACS459

Year/Semester:

Class Load: 6 Hrs. / Week (Theory: 3Hrs. Practical: 3 Hrs.)

Course Description: The course introduces the theoretical as well as practical concepts of
computer and information security. The course includes concepts of cryptographic algorithms,
authentication systems, access controls, malicious logics, network security and security audits.

Course Objectives: The objectives of this course are to familiarize the students with the
computer security concepts, security policies and security mechanisms so that students will be
able to design, implement and manage the secure computer systems.
