Course Title: Knowledge Engineering (3 Cr.)
Course Code: CACS458
Year/Semester: [V/VIII
Class Load: 5 Hrs. / Week (Theory: 3Hrs. Practical: 2 Hrs.)
Course Description
This course offers detailed concept about knowledge representation, logic, reasoning and
principles. It includes introduction, knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation and
reasoning. It does not entirely focus on theoretical concept but also strongly focuses on
practical skill based learning.
Course objectives
The general objectives of this course are to provide theoretical as well as practical knowledge
of knowledge engineering to make students capable of analysis, design, implementing and
managing of knowledge engineering in their personal as well professional life.
