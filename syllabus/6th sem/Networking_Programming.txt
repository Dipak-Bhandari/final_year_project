Course Description

This course is designed to extend students’ knowledge and practice in analysis and design of
computer networks by focusing on computer network programming. It includes introduction,
Internet Address, URLs and URIs, HTTP, URLConnections, Socket Programming, [P Multicast
and RMI. The JAVA programming language will be used throughout the course. [t does not
entirely focus on theoretical concept but also strongly focuses on practical skill based knowledge.

Course objectives

The general objectives of this course are to provide theoretical as well as practical knowledge of
network programming to make students capable of developing, implementing, managing and
troubleshooting the issues of network programming in their personal as well professional life.
