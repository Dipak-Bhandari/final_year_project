Course Title: Image Processing (3 Cr.)

Course Code: CACS404

Year/Semester: I'V/VIT

Class Load: 5 Hrs. / Week (Theory: 3Hrs. Practical: 2Hrs.)

Course Description
This course presents introduction to several topics on image processing techniques and their
applications. It also explores the students to real-world applications of image processing.

Course objectives
Upon completion of this course, students should be able to 1. Explain the basic concepts of

digital image processing and various image transforms. 2. Develop a broad range of image
processing techniques and their applications. 3. To familiarize the with the image
enhancement, image restoration and image segmentation techniques.
