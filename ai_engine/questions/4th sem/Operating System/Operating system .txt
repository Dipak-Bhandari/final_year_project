10, What is Disk Access Time and Disk Response Time? Suppose that a disk has 200 cylinders,
numbered (0-199). The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder 43 and previous request was

at cylinder 25. The queue of pending request, in FIFO order is: 55, 58, 39, 18, 90, 160, 150, 38, 184.
Starting from the current head position, what is total distance (in cylinders) that the disk arm moves

to satisfy all pending request for each of following disk scheduling algorithms? [2+8]
